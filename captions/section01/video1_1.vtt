Hi welcome to my course on A W-S with Python and both are three working with RLDS and Dynamo D.B and

00:10.210 --> 00:16.950
this course we're going to learn how to manipulate and how to work with RLDS or relational database

00:16.950 --> 00:19.490
service from A W-S.

00:19.650 --> 00:27.510
And once we finish with RLDS we're going to move on to Dynamo D-B know C cool and highly available database

00:27.510 --> 00:36.300
solution from AWOS while learning RLDS and Dynamo D-B with Python and both all three will be learning

00:36.300 --> 00:43.100
and discovering lots of great benefits with PI charme ID and PI both are three which is the autocomplete

00:43.110 --> 00:46.680
feature for Python and both are three.

00:46.770 --> 00:52.380
I designed this course to be where effective and very hands on and I believe you're going to like it.

00:52.460 --> 00:57.820
So without further ado let's take a look at what we're going to cover in this course.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.330
So I'll see you on the next with.
