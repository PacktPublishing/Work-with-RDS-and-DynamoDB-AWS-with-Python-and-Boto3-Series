00:01.740 --> 00:02.860
Before you start.

00:03.090 --> 00:09.640
Let's take a look at what you're going to get and what you're going to learn from their scores so and

00:09.640 --> 00:17.050
those scores will be working on A W-S with Python and both are through the API which is the most popular

00:17.050 --> 00:19.020
API of A W-S.

00:19.180 --> 00:26.860
And of course apart from the J-ws itself and in this course I'll explain everything but it's nice to

00:26.860 --> 00:34.090
know what our DS and dynamo would be beforehand so I'm not expecting you to be an expert on topics like

00:34.090 --> 00:42.220
our DS and Dynamo D.B and things like back up snapshots or global secondary indexes and other stuff

00:42.220 --> 00:49.660
like that for Dynamo D.B and RLDS but I'm hoping that you will is familiar with these topics and you

00:49.660 --> 00:57.370
feel comfortable to work with on Python and both those three and the most important part of this course

00:57.440 --> 01:00.240
is this course is a really hands on course.

01:00.280 --> 01:06.060
So you're not going to be drawn into PowerPoint or slideshows within the scores.

01:06.160 --> 01:11.490
I'm going to be doing almost everything with my code and nothing with a single touch.

01:11.510 --> 01:20.110
So apart from our introduction and summarizing lectures with some powerpoint slides I'm not going to

01:20.110 --> 01:22.220
do anything else with a presentation.

01:22.330 --> 01:26.840
I'm going to do everything hands on and within my chair my.

01:26.860 --> 01:32.950
So you're going to learn everything and every single detail about what I'm doing with a W-S and Python

01:32.950 --> 01:34.580
and both are three.

01:34.600 --> 01:41.710
So again we're going to develop our AWOS solution from scratch with Python and both are three.

01:41.830 --> 01:46.150
So we're going to launch our already s and why we're launching this RLDS.

01:46.240 --> 01:51.580
We're going to have our own security group and with the help of the security group we're going to limit

01:51.580 --> 01:56.160
the connections and inbound connections to our RLDS instance.

01:56.240 --> 02:00.860
And again just to emphasize will not do anything manually.

02:00.860 --> 02:08.830
It will be all automated with Python and both all three in the next lecture in the next week here.

02:08.860 --> 02:11.830
Let's take a look at what we're going to build on the scores.

02:11.890 --> 02:13.460
So I'll see on the next video.
