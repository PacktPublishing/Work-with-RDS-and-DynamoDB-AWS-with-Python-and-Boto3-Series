00:02.030 --> 00:05.980
So what are we going to build on the scores and scores.

00:06.110 --> 00:11.860
We're going to start off with preparing our environment to work with Python and both of three.

00:11.870 --> 00:13.720
And of course a WS.

00:13.850 --> 00:20.240
So we'll first start with preparing our environment and credentials getting from AWOS So we're going

00:20.240 --> 00:28.100
to go to I am from AWOS our identity and access management and we're going to create ourselves a user.

00:28.100 --> 00:34.550
And after we finish with that we're going to create ourselves A W-S credential so that we can access

00:34.580 --> 00:37.250
AWOS benefits programmatically.

00:37.250 --> 00:43.820
So once we get the credentials we're going to set those credentials to our environment using a WSC a

00:43.820 --> 00:50.780
lie which brings us to the installation of a a lie and I'm going to be showing you the on Mac OS and

00:50.780 --> 00:51.770
Windows.

00:52.010 --> 00:58.280
And after we set up our environment we're going to launch our I.D. and we're going to start implementing

00:58.280 --> 01:03.890
our solution on us and our solutions starting from Arley Yes.

01:03.890 --> 01:10.250
So for RLDS what we're going to need is we're going to need some D-B subnet groups and security groups

01:10.250 --> 01:14.150
so that we can place our Ardis instance within those.

01:14.150 --> 01:20.360
So once we have our security groups and support groups for our D-B instance we're going to be able to

01:20.360 --> 01:25.190
launch our post-career siecle RDX instance with a W-S environment.

01:25.400 --> 01:31.770
And for that environment we're going to be using E.U. 3 or Paris region.

01:31.950 --> 01:38.460
And once we finish with our RDA assistance we're going to move on to Dynamo D-B.

01:38.490 --> 01:46.230
So for Dynamo D-B since it's a global solution from a double U.S. We're going to launch our tables on

01:46.230 --> 01:47.660
dynamo D-B.

01:47.670 --> 01:54.150
We're going to provide a table name and we're going to provide a provision throughput which is same

01:54.150 --> 01:56.660
thing for IOPS on AWOS.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.610
And then we're going to provide the key schema.

01:59.820 --> 02:04.580
And the last part of the table definition is the attribute definitions.

02:04.650 --> 02:11.430
So we're going to provide every single key and what the type of value they're expecting to get to and

02:11.610 --> 02:18.270
once we're done with that we're going to learn how to describe how to modify and how to operate a table

02:18.540 --> 02:25.920
on dynamo D.B and the same thing goes for our Yes we're going to learn how to take a snapshot or backup

02:26.160 --> 02:28.340
in general cases from our.

02:28.530 --> 02:34.080
And we're willing to learn how to restore a database from an existing snapshot or a backup.

02:34.450 --> 02:39.830
And we're also going to learn how we can modify our D.S. instance on AWOS.

02:40.110 --> 02:46.750
And of course without saying we're all going to learn how to describe the resources on a double unit

02:46.860 --> 02:50.100
for both our ideas and Dynamo D-B.

02:50.100 --> 02:55.970
So again this is going to be we're a hands on cause and I'm hoping you're going to like it because there

02:55.970 --> 02:58.420
is such a great content waiting for you site.
