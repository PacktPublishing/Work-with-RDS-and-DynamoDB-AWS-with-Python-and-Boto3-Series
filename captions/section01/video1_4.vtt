00:01.650 --> 00:07.360
So before we jump into our implementation with AWOS and Python and both are three.

00:07.380 --> 00:13.650
Let's take a look at what I'm expecting you to have for this course and what you need beforehand like

00:13.650 --> 00:16.040
the prerequisites for this course.

00:16.050 --> 00:20.160
So the first thing is of course and AWOS account.

00:20.160 --> 00:23.870
I'm hoping you can have at least a free tier AWOS account.

00:23.880 --> 00:30.290
And again if your account is available for up to one year so you can get almost all the benefits.

00:30.330 --> 00:36.620
AWOS What does free account so you don't have to pay anything to a WS and you can play around with the

00:36.840 --> 00:42.310
things like RLDS by Nemo D-B Lamda and most of the stuff on A W-S.

00:42.360 --> 00:47.700
It's a great benefit and I hope you already have an account and if you don't I'm going to be showing

00:47.700 --> 00:49.940
you how to do that in the upcoming lectures.

00:49.950 --> 00:51.110
Don't worry about it.

00:51.450 --> 00:57.630
And then of course I'm hoping that you have some basic knowledge of what our ideas and Dynamo are the

00:57.840 --> 00:59.580
AWOS services are.

00:59.580 --> 01:05.100
So I'm hoping you have at least some working knowledge of our ideas and Dynamo divi And if you have

01:05.160 --> 01:06.360
that is awesome.

01:06.360 --> 01:11.990
Also since we're going to be working with Python I'm hoping you have some basic knowledge of python

01:12.630 --> 01:19.590
and this means things like how to find your way around in an ID or how to define a variable how to import

01:19.590 --> 01:22.800
stuff to your class and things like that.

01:22.800 --> 01:29.460
So this is like the basic stuff very basic stuff on Python and I'm hoping you have this information.

01:29.630 --> 01:33.810
And also if your experience with Python then that's just great.

01:34.740 --> 01:40.680
Also since we're going to be working with Python I'm going to need a python ID so that you can have

01:40.680 --> 01:43.160
it in your computer and you're installed already.

01:43.250 --> 01:49.890
Or if you don't already you can check out my charm ID from Jepp brains which is the like most preferred

01:49.890 --> 01:53.770
ID for Python and also has a free community edition.

01:53.910 --> 02:01.290
And if you're a student upbraids is giving away licenses for edu account emails for students.

02:01.290 --> 02:06.960
So if you're a student again you definitely have to check this out and get this offer says this offer.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.930
Covering all the Jeopardy's product not just pie charm ID.

02:10.950 --> 02:17.090
So without further ado let's just jump into our implementation and starting from preparing our environments

02:17.090 --> 02:18.800
so I'll see you on the next section.
