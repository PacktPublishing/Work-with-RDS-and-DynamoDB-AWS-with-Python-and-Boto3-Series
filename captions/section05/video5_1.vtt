All right we're about to start our journey with our D.S. or namely the relational database service from

00:08.800 --> 00:11.000
AWOS.

00:11.210 --> 00:19.240
Yes we can do many things like launching post-career school instances Amazon or Orah My sequel instances

00:19.570 --> 00:20.590
and much more.

00:20.710 --> 00:27.040
And you can even run my sequel from Microsoft and Oracle from Oracle itself.

00:27.950 --> 00:33.570
And to do all that we're going to start discovering RLDS one by one.

00:33.920 --> 00:42.930
We're going to first launch our own RLDS instance completely with our plight and implementation.

00:43.150 --> 00:50.110
And after we finished that we're going to start manipulating our RDA instance and we're of course going

00:50.110 --> 00:56.360
to learn how to take a backup and how to restore our database from that backup.

00:56.440 --> 01:02.930
So to check that out to learn how to do all that I'll be seeing you on the next videos.
