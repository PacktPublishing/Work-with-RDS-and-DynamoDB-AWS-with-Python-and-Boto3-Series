00:02.610 --> 00:11.400
Know take a look at how we can modify this D-B instance and to do that I'm going to go to my RLDS class

00:11.550 --> 00:19.440
and let's just close this and I'm going to go down to my described method and in there I'm going to

00:19.440 --> 00:29.490
simply say def modify and I simply going to modify my master user password so that I can just refresh

00:29.490 --> 00:41.520
it from time to time modify master user password and I'm going to pass in my D-B identifier

00:44.040 --> 00:52.700
and my new password so I can use it while calling my method modifying.

00:52.890 --> 00:55.410
And let's just print this out.

00:55.410 --> 01:00.530
Modifying master user password.

01:00.540 --> 01:01.730
All right.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.440
Now let's just return.

01:04.590 --> 01:11.660
Client not modify the instance.

01:11.670 --> 01:12.700
All right.

01:13.140 --> 01:18.490
And the first thing that I have to pass in is the D-B instance identifier.

01:18.510 --> 01:22.160
So let's just say DBI identifier.

01:22.560 --> 01:28.340
And as you can see we can simply change everything about our our DST instance.

01:28.470 --> 01:33.490
But in our case I'm just going to replace my password with a new one.

01:33.510 --> 01:39.340
So let's just say maß user password equals 2 new password.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.390
All right.

01:40.650 --> 01:48.830
So let's go to our test employment class and let's just call this method to make use of it.

01:49.050 --> 01:54.080
So modify master password.

01:54.480 --> 02:03.810
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to get the R D s client and call the modify master user password

02:04.320 --> 02:11.670
and for the instance identifier I'm going to go to my instance launching method and I'm going to get

02:11.670 --> 02:16.100
the D-B instance identifier just like that.

02:16.170 --> 02:22.430
So I'm going to pass Indes and I'm going to provide a new password.

02:22.680 --> 02:32.720
My brand new post gray and or my brand new password just like that.

02:32.730 --> 02:37.300
So this is all I have to do to modify my D-B instance.

02:37.380 --> 02:42.860
And we can verify this while connecting with the post-IPO client.

02:42.930 --> 02:54.150
So let's call this method let's just comment this out and modify maß password and let's just hit run.

02:54.370 --> 02:55.620
And here we go.

02:55.690 --> 02:58.600
Our execution is already complete.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.860
And let's go to our post Tiko collide.

03:02.020 --> 03:08.270
And as you can remember we already have our configuration within the postcode client.

03:08.470 --> 03:16.350
So if we try to connect to our post-IPO client with our old password we won't be able to do that.

03:16.360 --> 03:25.950
So let's just try it and as you can see it just simply cannot connect to the pulse he call instance

03:26.580 --> 03:34.500
and if he again tried to give the old password for our RLDS instance you won't be able to connect to

03:34.500 --> 03:35.020
it.

03:35.130 --> 03:43.020
And as you can see password authentication failed for user postchaise and you just simply edit this

03:43.170 --> 03:51.930
and go back to our new password and copy it and if paste it right here and if he had connect.

03:52.230 --> 03:59.720
And here we go our master user password is just modify it with just a simple API call.

03:59.760 --> 04:00.780
Simple as that.
