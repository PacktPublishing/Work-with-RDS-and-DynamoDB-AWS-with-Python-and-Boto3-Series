00:02.060 --> 00:08.350
So let's assume that we're done with our audiences and we just simply want to delete it.

00:08.510 --> 00:13.570
How we do that the way to do that is quite simple actually.

00:13.580 --> 00:22.580
So now let's go to our RLDS class and within our audience class after our restore method let's just

00:22.580 --> 00:25.610
say to eat.

00:26.180 --> 00:35.650
And from there of course we're going to have to provide an identifier to this method as we all the methods

00:35.690 --> 00:39.820
all the other methods of AWOS are the client.

00:40.430 --> 00:53.750
And let's just print out that deleting RLDS instance with name and B identifier and let's just return

00:54.270 --> 01:01.550
self-taught client dot delete D-B instance.

01:02.090 --> 01:13.420
And if I hit Enter I'm going to pass in the DB instance identifier as this and there is a flag from

01:13.450 --> 01:17.520
A W-S as Skip final snapshot.

01:17.560 --> 01:26.020
So what this means is that when we try to delete a RLDS instance on a US AWOS automatically takes a

01:26.020 --> 01:29.220
snapshot of that D-B before deleting it.

01:29.230 --> 01:37.390
So if we pass in true within this method AWOS won't be able to take a backup take a snapshot before

01:37.390 --> 01:41.830
we delete this instance so it's going to simply delete this Aston's right away.

01:41.980 --> 01:50.200
But if you set this flag to false and you're going to have to provide a final D-B snapshot identifier

01:50.200 --> 01:52.560
to be created on AWOS.

01:52.720 --> 01:57.920
So I'm going to simply say skip file snapshot as true.

01:58.240 --> 01:59.600
And here we go.

02:00.190 --> 02:09.230
Let's just go to our deployment class and let's just define a method and delete the B.

02:09.260 --> 02:13.540
Let's get our Yes and Flete database.

02:13.630 --> 02:22.360
So to delete that database I'm going to use since we have launched a database from our previous snapshot

02:22.660 --> 02:25.570
I can simply call it for this database.

02:25.750 --> 02:28.810
And here we go.

02:28.870 --> 02:38.310
So if I go down and call this method just like this let's see what's going to happen.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.360
Here we go.

02:42.690 --> 02:48.360
Our Arrius sensors must be deleted on a WS.

02:48.440 --> 02:57.040
And as you can see this being deleted right now and if we also want to delete the pulse post be we can

02:57.040 --> 03:01.730
just simply provide the identifier here and we can just delete it.

03:01.900 --> 03:02.690
Just like that.
