00:01.760 --> 00:07.820
Before we move on let's take a look at what we've done in this section and this was a very long section.

00:07.820 --> 00:12.880
I know but we learned a lot about our ideas and how to work with our.

00:12.900 --> 00:14.210
Yes.

00:14.210 --> 00:20.590
So in this section we first set up our project with PI charme ID.

00:20.630 --> 00:22.280
We created our project.

00:22.280 --> 00:31.000
We set our Python interpreter and everything and then we configured and launched on our D.S. Pasqua

00:31.000 --> 00:32.260
sequel instance.

00:32.340 --> 00:41.460
And to do that we had to create a security group and if we used the easy two way or the BPC way of the

00:41.460 --> 00:48.890
subnets we we first have to provide the sublets and the PC IDs for that security group.

00:48.960 --> 00:56.610
And the purpose the way that we do this was because we had to allow incoming connections to our RLDS

00:56.670 --> 00:57.630
instances.

00:57.900 --> 01:05.250
And in case this is going to be a private TV you may choose to not provide any incoming connections

01:05.250 --> 01:07.760
to your RLDS instance.

01:07.870 --> 01:16.570
And after that we checked out the Aria's instance that we launched on AWOS console and then we learn

01:16.570 --> 01:24.370
how we could describe our audience instance with API calls and then we modified our master user password

01:24.370 --> 01:31.470
and verified it while trying to log into our DV instance with pos Tiko client.

01:31.930 --> 01:39.400
And then we added tax of course we added tax when we launch our RLDS instance in the first place and

01:39.400 --> 01:47.530
we learn how to take a back up or take a snapshot of our D.S. instance and then we simply restore that

01:48.140 --> 01:48.850
instance.

01:49.000 --> 01:58.990
And then finally we deleted our RLDS instance altogether from AWOS and I believe this was a very great

01:59.180 --> 02:05.060
we're hands on section and on all of the calls about is hand-sewn actually.

02:05.080 --> 02:11.810
So I believe you learned a lot about our ideas and how you can get up to two lounging production great

02:11.970 --> 02:14.750
ideas instances with this knowledge.

02:14.920 --> 02:16.570
So I'll be seeing you on the next section.
