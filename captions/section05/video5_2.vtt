00:01.360 --> 00:08.840
So I logged into my AWOS console and you can see that my console is ready to Manoo play it.

00:08.860 --> 00:13.730
So the first thing that we're going to do is of course check out the art.

00:13.770 --> 00:14.550
Yes.

00:14.560 --> 00:23.380
So to do that you can either go to services and type in already yes or you can go back and just from

00:23.380 --> 00:29.260
the dashboard you can just say yes it's just simply the same thing.

00:29.260 --> 00:36.600
And I'm going to hit click and Dan RDR Service is now initialising for me.

00:37.130 --> 00:39.780
And here we go.

00:39.800 --> 00:46.340
So as you can see now I don't have any RLDS instances or any other resources related to our.

00:46.370 --> 00:46.940
Yes.

00:46.970 --> 00:50.320
So it is saying me that I can get started now.

00:50.540 --> 00:57.560
So what we're going to do in this section is we're going to launch our own our D.S. instances and as

00:57.560 --> 01:00.180
you can see I don't have any of them right now.

01:00.350 --> 01:08.360
And just like we can do from here like clicking on launch and RLDS instance and selecting the vendor

01:08.360 --> 01:15.280
or the engine of your Ardis instance we're going to do all of that from our Polytone implementation.

01:15.350 --> 01:23.750
So so as you can see it is going to be a great exercise to know how to launch RLDS instances because

01:24.020 --> 01:31.820
when you're working in a real environment or in a actual real project to use an RDX instance you're

01:31.820 --> 01:36.280
going to have to probably do that with the help of the API.

01:36.530 --> 01:45.060
Iturbi and other kind of API like a WSC all by itself or and with the most preferred way as the python.

01:45.330 --> 01:47.920
You're going to have to know how to do that.

01:47.930 --> 01:55.020
So this is going to be a great exercise says because we're going to not just only lounge are our D.S.

01:55.050 --> 02:00.950
instance we're going to learn how to take the backup or snapshot in the term of art.

02:00.950 --> 02:01.560
Yes.

02:01.760 --> 02:07.430
And then we're going to learn how to restore that DB from that snapshot.

02:07.430 --> 02:08.170
All right.

02:08.240 --> 02:15.720
So let's go to our next video and start implementing our RLDS instance implementation.
