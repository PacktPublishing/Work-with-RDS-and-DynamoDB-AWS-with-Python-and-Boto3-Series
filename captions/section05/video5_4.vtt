00:02.340 --> 00:10.290
Before we jump into our implementation Let's go and take healthy both of 3 RLDS documentation and see

00:10.290 --> 00:11.940
what we can get from there.

00:12.030 --> 00:21.120
So in a search engine with your perforation I think it is Google but let's just type in both L3 and

00:21.330 --> 00:23.580
our Yes.

00:23.690 --> 00:31.630
And as you can see we have the Ardelia's documentation on top of the result list so let's click on it.

00:33.430 --> 00:38.860
And as you can see we have the RLDS client for both all three.

00:39.190 --> 00:49.210
And you can see that we have a huge list of methods for RLDS from taking a backup to creating D-B clusters

00:49.240 --> 00:56.840
and everything else about RLDS is ready to be implemented with Python and both all three.

00:56.860 --> 01:07.240
And if we go down and check out a simple method let's just say describe D-B instance which is the actual

01:07.240 --> 01:10.310
method that we're going to implement in the later sections.

01:10.540 --> 01:18.280
As you can see it says it returns information about provisioned RLDS instances and as you can see this

01:18.310 --> 01:20.500
API supports pagination.

01:20.500 --> 01:29.740
So you can return large amounts of RLDS instance list and you can paginate within those instances.

01:29.740 --> 01:37.450
And as you can see it is expecting a D-B instance identifier and an optional argument as filters and

01:37.450 --> 01:38.330
so on.

01:38.680 --> 01:46.300
So the nice thing about this bowlful 3 documentation it is a huge amount of documentation that you can

01:46.300 --> 01:54.190
find for a client like this because both the three is highly supported from A W-S.

01:54.210 --> 02:00.510
And recently actually AWOS itself is implementing both three API.

02:00.730 --> 02:09.250
So if there is any other news service from a US not dislike RLDS completely new service from us and

02:09.490 --> 02:11.420
you can get the API for that.

02:11.470 --> 02:18.130
Andi just simply the later day it's just a great way to implement a deal us.

02:18.340 --> 02:21.700
The bowlful three way is the best way actually.

02:21.700 --> 02:30.550
So as you can see this API is huge and you can see the response syntax and you can just write your code

02:30.580 --> 02:38.530
write your API against this API and you can have a solid foundation for the AWOS implementation.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.590
So this is basically all we have to know about.

02:42.730 --> 02:49.830
Both all three documentation and I'm going to definitely go and put the link on to my description.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.670
And as you can see it's just simply both.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.280
3. we did Dogstar IO.

02:55.360 --> 03:03.310
And if you can check out the other implementations you're going to see that this is just simply a beautiful

03:03.310 --> 03:08.640
documentation from both of three guys.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.040
So in the next videos.

03:11.290 --> 03:17.100
Let's just jump right into our implementation and see what we can do with RLDS.
