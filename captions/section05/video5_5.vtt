Show while we're making our implementation we're going to use a great helping hand from PI both of three.

00:11.240 --> 00:19.760
So what's it about pi both three PI both of three as you can see is a pythonic interface for AWOS both

00:19.760 --> 00:20.450
of three.

00:20.570 --> 00:28.470
That gives you all to complete on every service and you just didn't hurt or misunderstood it.

00:28.520 --> 00:36.200
It is autocomplete feature for Python and both are three implementations and if we go down here and

00:36.200 --> 00:43.970
as you can see if you define your type using pi both the three you can get the autocomplete beauty of

00:44.270 --> 00:47.770
Python Id actually the PI charme ID.

00:47.900 --> 00:52.760
And this is a beautiful way and a great way to implement python.

00:52.790 --> 00:55.290
And both are three four AWOS.

00:55.760 --> 01:02.900
And as you can see you can see the definitions and descriptions of methods using the shortcuts and you

01:02.900 --> 01:10.160
can just give yourself a huge relief while implementing Python with both of three.

01:10.280 --> 01:17.200
So all you have to do is Pipp install pide both three and you can just import both those three.

01:17.330 --> 01:22.760
And then you can use it with PI both or three as your autocomplete.

01:22.760 --> 01:30.110
So since I already have the PI both free and you can just simply install using Pipp install py both

01:30.120 --> 01:30.970
are free.

01:31.010 --> 01:38.300
I'm just going to go back to my ID and to see to give you a feel of what it looks like and what it feels

01:38.300 --> 01:38.790
like.

01:38.930 --> 01:45.630
So let's switch back to our ID and I'm going to create my R D S class.

01:45.950 --> 01:50.580
So I'm going to create a new file as namely.

01:50.650 --> 01:51.400
Yes.

01:51.680 --> 02:01.910
And within that file I'm just going to define my art class and for my RDX class first thing that I have

02:01.910 --> 02:05.620
to do is to get the client implementation of.

02:05.710 --> 02:10.070
Yesterday i just did here with the Klein factory.

02:10.310 --> 02:18.290
So within that initialiser method what I'm going to do is I'm going to pass in the client while I'm

02:18.290 --> 02:26.810
calling this RLDS class and I'm going to inject declined to the client that I'm going to receive from

02:26.810 --> 02:28.000
that method call.

02:28.010 --> 02:36.770
So I'm going to say self-taught underscore client equals the client and the most important part in this

02:36.770 --> 02:41.030
lecture with the PI both are three autocomplete part.

02:41.030 --> 02:49.460
So to have that capability I'm going to go down under my self-doubt client equals client expression

02:50.150 --> 02:54.440
and I'm going to put in three double quotes as you can see.

02:54.620 --> 03:02.930
And within those double quotes I'm going to say type and as you can see IDs are completing and I can

03:03.620 --> 03:10.320
say that PI both three dot are yes just like that.

03:10.340 --> 03:16.590
This is all you have to do to have the PI both three capability for your ID.

03:16.820 --> 03:24.370
So let's just create a simple method test method so that we can see how this works.

03:24.380 --> 03:32.030
So I'm just going to call my client first of course and self-doubt underscore client and then when I

03:32.030 --> 03:38.740
hit dot as you can see it is already up to completing my RTX client.

03:38.810 --> 03:48.620
And as you can see Adderall to D-B cluster apply painting maintenance action and I can simply call any

03:48.620 --> 03:57.950
of the methods from my both or three API documentation and the best part is when I hit enter you can

03:57.950 --> 04:05.750
get the full mirthfulness full argument of the method you can work your way up from there just like

04:05.750 --> 04:06.770
that.

04:06.800 --> 04:12.330
It's a beautiful implementation with the Python and both all three.

04:12.380 --> 04:19.400
So you definitely have to use this while implementing anything with Python and both of three we're going

04:19.400 --> 04:26.120
to be making use of this within our lectures for both yes and Dynamo the.
