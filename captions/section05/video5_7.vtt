WEBVTT

00:01.290 --> 00:02.610
All right.

00:02.610 --> 00:08.100
So these are all the submit ideas that I need for my D-B creation.

00:10.240 --> 00:18.560
And no I can get back to what I was doing and which is the launching a post-career sequel instance.

00:18.640 --> 00:24.270
So let's go down to the method and let's just check out the parameters.

00:24.310 --> 00:30.530
So the first thing that I have to provide is a database name for my database name.

00:30.550 --> 00:36.570
I'm going to say my pulse great sequel database.

00:36.580 --> 00:38.320
All right.

00:38.620 --> 00:50.990
And for a database instance identifier I'm going to say my pulse gray post-trade the be all right.

00:51.870 --> 01:00.750
And after that I'm going to have to provide a D-B instance class and the D-B instance class is of course

01:00.990 --> 01:08.010
going to be a free tier D and which is just the the dot T-2 dot micro.

01:08.010 --> 01:16.050
If you try to launch any other thing than D-B to D-B dot to the micro you're going to be charge and

01:16.290 --> 01:18.760
you're just going to have to be careful about that.

01:19.320 --> 01:25.730
And for the engine of that TV I'm going to say to simply postscripts.

01:25.840 --> 01:26.800
All right.

01:27.630 --> 01:37.500
And with the engine version I'm just going to say the engine version is going to be 9 out 6.6 and for

01:37.530 --> 01:45.300
all the values of these parameters for this D-B launching for Pasqua sequel you can thoroughly check

01:45.300 --> 01:50.550
out the both or three documentation and of course AWOS itself.

01:51.420 --> 02:00.720
And for the pt. s. I'm going to simply use the default port for our D.S. post-career sequel instance

02:01.800 --> 02:09.780
and the other thing that I need is a master username and for the master username I'm just simply going

02:09.780 --> 02:14.310
to use Pulse Chris and for my master password.

02:14.850 --> 02:18.690
I'm going to say my post-play

02:22.350 --> 02:24.450
and password.

02:24.450 --> 02:25.280
All right.

02:26.920 --> 02:32.720
And the other thing that I want to allocate is the storage itself.

02:32.770 --> 02:43.000
So for the storage I'm going to simply say 20 gigs of this size for my D-B instance and the next thing

02:43.000 --> 02:49.360
that I want to say I don't want any multi availabilities zone deployment for my D-B instance since this

02:49.360 --> 02:55.840
is going to be a simple development TB and of course you can with your production the base production

02:55.840 --> 03:04.900
level the actually have to use the Malte availability on deployments and 40 storage type.

03:05.320 --> 03:10.300
I'm going to simply say I want to a general propose as is the storage.

03:10.360 --> 03:17.150
I don't want the high troop worth IOPS or anything else since this is just the development D-B.

03:17.440 --> 03:26.910
And so I want my to be accessible from public resources I can just simply say publicly accessible and

03:26.920 --> 03:31.740
through but just saying the publicly accessible is not enough.

03:31.750 --> 03:36.700
We created our D-B Security Group and added and in-bound rule.

03:36.820 --> 03:43.060
If you don't do that you win if you say that you want a publicly accessible Ardis instance you won't

03:43.060 --> 03:45.520
be able to access your audiences.

03:45.560 --> 03:46.670
So right.

03:46.690 --> 03:48.440
Just be careful about that.

03:48.850 --> 03:55.340
And the other thing that I have to provide is the PC security group ids.

03:55.690 --> 04:04.480
So since this is a list of IDS I have to provide it within a list and I have to get the security group

04:04.540 --> 04:09.490
ID from my method which is right below my.

04:10.240 --> 04:14.050
As you can see here create D-B security group and add rules.

04:14.080 --> 04:18.030
So this method is returning the security group ID.

04:18.040 --> 04:30.880
So let's just make a quick call that this method Security Group ID and self-taught create D-B security

04:30.880 --> 04:32.410
group and add rules.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.820
All right.

04:33.820 --> 04:37.940
So this is going to you media security group that I need.

04:37.990 --> 04:48.310
And before we finish before we wrap this up let's just also say the D-B submit group name and that subnet

04:48.310 --> 04:55.710
group name is of course RLDS D-B subnetwork name that I am going to create.

04:55.960 --> 05:08.460
And with the attacks I'm going to say within a list of elements and the first element is with the key

05:08.510 --> 05:10.320
available CIM of hers.

05:10.570 --> 05:16.270
I'm going to say key is name and de-value is

05:19.490 --> 05:24.380
let's just type in my own name and post.

05:25.380 --> 05:26.140
Sequel

05:28.470 --> 05:29.300
instance.

05:29.310 --> 05:31.210
All right.

05:31.590 --> 05:37.800
So this is basically everything that we need to create our already Yes instance

05:43.990 --> 05:52.750
so to test things out to lounge and RLDS instance this is create a simple test class and let's just

05:52.750 --> 05:55.000
name it test deployment.

05:55.000 --> 05:55.930
All right.

05:56.470 --> 06:03.760
And with that test deployment class what I'm going to do is I'm going to deploy my resources within

06:03.760 --> 06:08.450
a single method just couple of method calls.

06:08.540 --> 06:20.600
So let's just say I want to deploy my resources within a single method to deploy resources and within

06:20.600 --> 06:28.010
that method I'm going to need the artist client for my debut launching and that's simply everything

06:28.010 --> 06:30.340
I need to call this method.

06:30.560 --> 06:43.940
So let's just take the RDX client from SIRC and Clive factory our client and of course from SIRC Dot

06:44.030 --> 06:48.080
are yes and RLDS itself.

06:48.110 --> 06:50.090
All right.

06:50.090 --> 07:00.830
So this is everything I need to launch my D-B instance and for my RLDS client let's just say RTX client

07:02.210 --> 07:07.260
and get client and RLDS is going to be simple.

07:07.280 --> 07:16.460
So ARDE Yes and I'm going to pass in the RDF client inside it so I can just simply call them my RLDS

07:17.090 --> 07:21.960
create post-career sequel instance method just like that.

07:21.980 --> 07:36.890
So and maybe I can just print out that I'm launching an art class instance creating RDX post-K sequel

07:37.250 --> 07:39.740
instance.

07:39.770 --> 07:40.740
All right.

07:41.000 --> 07:50.960
And to call this method I'm going to simply going to need a main method and I can just say deploy resources

07:51.170 --> 07:51.910
just like that.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.650
And let's just give it a line break here.

07:54.770 --> 08:02.210
So we're now ready to test out our method for lounging and Ardelia's instance.

08:02.330 --> 08:09.680
So if we go here and Tron and let's see what's going to happen.

08:09.730 --> 08:10.660
All right.

08:10.660 --> 08:18.360
Our Amazon RLDS says and oops we have a problem with our PC

08:20.960 --> 08:30.970
so this is only because that we simply forgot to call our create subnet group method and it's this method

08:31.010 --> 08:35.090
and we simply forgot to create our D-B subnet group.

08:35.180 --> 08:46.640
So let's go down here within the Create Pasqua sequel instance and this is create subnet group and within

08:46.640 --> 08:52.980
that let's just call self-taught create an D-B subnet group.

08:53.000 --> 09:03.480
So let's also print out debt we're creating DP subnet group and just like that.

09:03.500 --> 09:14.820
So let's just go and let's just try to call this and but before we go and do dat let's just go back

09:14.850 --> 09:20.770
and delete our resources for our security group.

09:21.080 --> 09:33.290
So let's just go to a W-S console like now and and go to E C too so that we don't have the conflicting

09:33.290 --> 09:40.160
resources and we can successfully create our security groups and resources.

09:40.160 --> 09:44.170
So as you can see our public security group is right there.

09:44.300 --> 09:49.380
And if I go here are the actions and delete the security crew.

09:49.550 --> 09:51.270
And here we go.

09:51.320 --> 10:00.580
So let's go back and let's just redrawn our application and I'm going to hit one.

10:00.740 --> 10:09.590
And as you can see all of our resources are almost created and you can check out from the last statement

10:09.590 --> 10:15.300
that we printed out here that are RDR security group is created.

10:15.470 --> 10:23.090
And we could successfully at the inbound accessible to our security group and we created our own D-B

10:23.090 --> 10:29.600
subnet group and our post-career sequel already instance is now being launched.

10:29.630 --> 10:37.100
So this is everything that we're going to do to lounge and RLDS instance and in the next video we're

10:37.100 --> 10:41.250
going to check out our RLDS instance on AWOS Konsole.
