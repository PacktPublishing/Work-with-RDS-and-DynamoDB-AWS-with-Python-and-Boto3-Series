00:02.920 --> 00:06.000
So we're on our AWOS console.

00:06.060 --> 00:14.100
And and if you remember from our last time we deleted our security group that we could created accidentally.

00:14.230 --> 00:26.170
And if I hit refresh and as you can see our RDF public security group is created with the proper naming

00:26.170 --> 00:32.620
and description and if you check out the inbound rules we can see that we're allowing connections from

00:32.620 --> 00:35.320
port five four three two.

00:35.440 --> 00:43.600
And with any source from anywhere to be connected to our RDX instance so we're good with the security

00:43.600 --> 00:44.360
groups.

00:44.560 --> 00:53.170
So if we go and check out the audience itself we're going to see that we how are our TS instance there

00:53.230 --> 00:54.790
and here we go.

00:55.210 --> 00:59.630
So are the instances already initialized then lunch.

00:59.680 --> 01:07.780
And it is in the state of backing up by AWOS and automatically this process is completely automatically

01:07.780 --> 01:12.790
done by AWOS itself for any disaster recovery.

01:12.790 --> 01:19.810
And if we go and check the subnet groups for our security group and as you can see it's just there.

01:20.170 --> 01:25.460
So our D-B is now being spent two different subnets.

01:25.510 --> 01:33.250
And if you want to enable the Malte a Z or Malte availability zone the subnets are going to be used

01:33.250 --> 01:37.590
to spend our D-B instances within those subnets.

01:37.600 --> 01:41.490
So as you can see our D-B is almost ready to use.

01:41.500 --> 01:48.880
But if you want to interact with our D-B instance we have to see the status as a vailable right here

01:49.090 --> 01:53.560
so that we can connect to and manipulate our data with them.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.470
Our DSD be for instance.

01:55.480 --> 01:56.020
All right.
