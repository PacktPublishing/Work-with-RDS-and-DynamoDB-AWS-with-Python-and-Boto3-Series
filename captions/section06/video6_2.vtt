All right I opened up my AWOS console and what I'm going to do now is I'm going to go to Dynamo D-B.

00:11.060 --> 00:12.110
And here we go.

00:15.170 --> 00:23.420
So dynamo D-B dashboard is up against me and as you can see it's a no sequel database for all kinds

00:23.420 --> 00:28.760
of applications with a highly reliable and performance way.

00:28.760 --> 00:34.310
So as you can see I don't have any tables currently with Dynamo DB.

00:34.430 --> 00:37.790
So AWOS is showing me this display.

00:37.790 --> 00:45.210
So of course I can go and create tables with the dashboard of a W-S console and with the help of it.

00:45.290 --> 00:49.760
But we're going to do all of that with our Python API.

00:49.760 --> 00:56.360
So we're going to be making use of create tables updates and everything else.

00:56.360 --> 01:01.160
So we're going to be implementing all of those actions with our code.

01:01.310 --> 01:07.450
So to start creating our project with PI charme ID I'll be seeing you on the next video.
