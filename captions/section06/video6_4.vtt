00:01.970 --> 00:08.350
Before we jump into our implementations with Emily let's take a moment to check out the both of the

00:08.570 --> 00:10.260
API documentation.

00:10.760 --> 00:19.190
So as you can see I know he has a huge list of methods to manipulate your tables and everything in between

00:19.190 --> 00:19.860
them.

00:19.910 --> 00:27.800
So as you can see you can use backup methods you can delete tables you can create tables and you can

00:27.800 --> 00:36.590
do stuff with Nemo deeply and if you just go to one of those methods as like create a table you can

00:36.590 --> 00:44.900
see that it is a very nice documentation about vitamin D and how we can work with it and you can also

00:44.900 --> 00:51.140
see the parameters and what they are required for or even if they are optional or required.

00:51.140 --> 00:59.210
And finally after three parameters you can see the return syntax for this method which is really nice

00:59.210 --> 01:02.600
because you can simply type your implementation.

01:02.660 --> 01:09.640
You can simply write your implementation against this return type return dictionary actually.

01:09.730 --> 01:17.720
So both of free has a really cool and really nice API for dynamic deviation and you can go and check

01:17.720 --> 01:21.980
this API at Boville 3.3 Darkstar.

01:22.330 --> 01:24.600
And then searching for dynamic ADP.
