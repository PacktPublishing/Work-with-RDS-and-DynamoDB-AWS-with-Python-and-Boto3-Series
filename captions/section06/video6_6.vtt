00:01.220 --> 00:06.400
So now let's take a look at the table dynamo D-B table that we just created.

00:06.620 --> 00:13.220
And since I opened up my browser previously I can't see my table right here so I'm going to hit refresh

00:13.220 --> 00:14.030
right now.

00:16.400 --> 00:17.810
And here we go.

00:18.020 --> 00:22.040
Our dynamo TB table is present right here.

00:22.040 --> 00:30.260
And if I go one hit on the name of the table I can see everything about my table with its default properties

00:30.400 --> 00:34.130
to the properties that I sent in to my table.

00:34.130 --> 00:43.110
And as you can see the capacity for this table is estimated for like dollars and 45 cents per month.

00:43.340 --> 00:50.270
And if I had indexes I could see them here and I can simply see everything about my dynamic the table

00:50.270 --> 00:51.520
right here.

00:51.860 --> 00:55.470
So we could successfully create our dynamo D-B.

00:55.490 --> 01:01.300
So let's move on with our implementation and see what else we can do with Dynamo or D-B.
