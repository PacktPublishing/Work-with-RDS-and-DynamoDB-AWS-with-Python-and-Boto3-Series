00:02.420 --> 00:08.070
So how about if you want to update our dynamo D-B table for example.

00:08.120 --> 00:16.490
We want to increase the read and write capacity or throughput for our dynamo table if for seeing instant

00:16.760 --> 00:22.210
high accesses for our data and high reads and writes for our data.

00:22.310 --> 00:25.640
So how we're going to do that to do that.

00:25.910 --> 00:31.970
Let's go to our dynamic D-B class and from there let's just say update

00:36.100 --> 00:41.240
Crete right capacity.

00:41.240 --> 00:42.340
All right.

00:42.430 --> 00:53.020
And from there I'm going to provide my table name and also what I'm going to do is I'm going to say

00:53.650 --> 00:56.550
new real capacity.

00:57.970 --> 01:02.530
And I also say new ride capacity.

01:03.130 --> 01:10.430
So these are the elements that I'm going to update on my table and let's take out our API documentation.

01:10.450 --> 01:20.710
But before that let's print out a statement updating provision at throughput

01:25.790 --> 01:31.520
of table with name and the table name.

01:31.520 --> 01:32.590
All right.

01:33.170 --> 01:38.770
So let's just fix that typo right here with the throughput.

01:39.010 --> 01:40.230
Whoops.

01:43.210 --> 01:49.140
And so now let's take out the documentation and see what we have to provide.

01:49.390 --> 01:54.740
Self-taught underscore client and update table.

01:54.850 --> 01:58.420
This is the method that we're going to use.

01:58.420 --> 02:03.720
So within this method as you can see we can pro-white lots of different things.

02:03.880 --> 02:11.170
But one of the required parameters of this method is the table name and we can optionally provide attribute

02:11.170 --> 02:12.210
definitions.

02:12.370 --> 02:21.490
We can update our global secondary index and we can update the stream dynamic DBI stream definition.

02:21.490 --> 02:27.530
So for our case what I'm going to do is I'm going to provide my table name.

02:27.580 --> 02:35.390
So this is going to be the table that I'm going to update and I'm going to provide a new provision throughput.

02:35.590 --> 02:40.990
So for the new provision throughput as you can see the type is dictionary.

02:41.050 --> 02:48.400
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to wrap my properties within a dictionary and I'm going to say

02:48.640 --> 02:53.040
read capacity units.

02:53.260 --> 02:57.630
So this is going to be new read capacity.

02:58.940 --> 03:01.370
Opes let's just fix this typo.

03:01.370 --> 03:08.450
And so let's also say write capacity units.

03:08.780 --> 03:11.630
So new right capacity.

03:11.630 --> 03:12.790
All right.

03:12.980 --> 03:17.570
So this is basically everything I need to update my table.

03:17.930 --> 03:26.860
So let's go back to our manager class management class and from there I'm going to add a new method.

03:27.440 --> 03:31.160
Update table IOPS.

03:31.550 --> 03:39.830
And within that method what I'm going to do is I'm going to first get the dynamo D-B client and I'm

03:39.830 --> 03:46.970
going to call the update read write capacity for the table name.

03:47.030 --> 03:56.210
I'm going to again pro-ID movies so I'm going to updating my table my existing table and forward a new

03:56.210 --> 03:56.880
provision.

03:56.900 --> 04:05.210
IOPS since I have five and five for read five for write for initial methods what I'm going to do is

04:05.390 --> 04:11.600
I'm going to increase this number to 10 for each of the elements for both read and write.

04:11.600 --> 04:19.250
So let's just call this method and see what's going to happen on AWOS consol.

04:19.310 --> 04:25.050
So I'm going to go down here and I'm going to say update table IOPS.

04:25.070 --> 04:26.100
All right.

04:26.750 --> 04:31.390
So let's hit run and let's see what's going to happen.

04:32.950 --> 04:33.890
Here we go.

04:34.240 --> 04:38.730
So our table must have been updated on a W-S.

04:38.950 --> 04:44.830
Let's go to DAWE AS console and see what's happened with our table.

04:45.250 --> 04:54.850
So if I just go back to the table and hit refresh I can see that my total read capacity and my total

04:54.850 --> 04:59.390
right capacity is increased to ten just as I was expecting.

04:59.410 --> 05:03.610
So we could update our table with ease with this method call.
