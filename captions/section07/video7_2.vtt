WEBVTT

00:01.380 --> 00:08.340
So let's take a look at what's coming next after discourse and what you can do about learning more of

00:08.400 --> 00:11.650
a W-S with Python and both all three.

00:12.220 --> 00:20.260
So this course is first of all is a part of a series of courses on A W-S saw this is not just a single

00:20.260 --> 00:21.080
course.

00:21.160 --> 00:26.400
Previously I had other courses like BPC and easy to.

00:26.410 --> 00:33.710
And since this is the first part of the courses there are more of the AWOS courses are coming up.

00:33.760 --> 00:44.890
I'm going to be working on most of the AWOS topics and courses on simply every subject of A W-S so you

00:44.890 --> 00:53.290
can learn more about A W-S Python and bowlful three more and more in my upcoming lectures and courses

00:54.670 --> 01:01.240
and of course with the exception of the scores I'm going to be working on and nonrecourse with our D.S.

01:01.240 --> 01:09.250
and Dynamo D-B never going to implement our own database with an actual data and we're going to learn

01:09.250 --> 01:13.570
how we can connect to the Aria's instance that we created.

01:13.660 --> 01:18.900
And we're going to insert read update and delete some data.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.820
And the same goes for the dynamo ODP.

01:22.000 --> 01:29.280
We're going to create some tables and we're going to implement at some data and then we're going to

01:29.330 --> 01:34.060
scan query and read and write all of those datas.

01:34.090 --> 01:38.250
So it's going to be another great course on our ideas and Dynamo D.

01:38.260 --> 01:40.810
And please stay tuned for that.

01:40.930 --> 01:49.390
And of course the rest of the courses on AWOS has topics like Lambda S S S and S and much more.

01:49.420 --> 01:53.410
So please stay tuned about my courses on AWOS.

01:53.440 --> 02:00.590
So if you want to learn more about AWOS implementations with Python and Dynamo DP and Ardi.

02:00.640 --> 02:05.380
And most of recourses most of the topics on AWOS.
