00:00.850 --> 00:06.170
All right we've finished our course on RLDS and Dynamo D-B.

00:06.490 --> 00:11.230
And I'd like to give you a huge tank for joining me in this course.

00:11.230 --> 00:18.920
This course was a great Henzen course I believe to learn more about AWOS Python and both of three.

00:19.240 --> 00:26.290
So if you want to implement your own RLDS solutions or if you want to implement your own dynamo D-B

00:26.290 --> 00:30.940
tables and you want to maybe update them or describe them.

00:31.120 --> 00:35.380
Take backups of them are simply everything about dynamo D-B.

00:35.380 --> 00:42.420
You can now you can go out and implement your own solutions based on what you've seen here.

00:42.430 --> 00:45.360
So again I'd like to thank you very much.

00:45.400 --> 00:52.990
And also I'd like to thank my wife for giving me this opportunity create this course so for the next

00:52.990 --> 01:00.370
sections of AWOS I'll be preparing more of the AWOS taste of python and both those three.

01:00.490 --> 01:05.460
So stay tuned for my courses and I'll be seeing you on the next one.
